              <p>
                I'm currently a Class 12 student with PCMB, but honestly,
                my main interest is not in Biology anymore. Before 9th class,
                I used to think that I would go into the medical field in the
                future, but as time passed, I started getting more interested
                in computers and technology.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 11th class, I explored coding more seriously and slowly
                developed a strong interest in programming, cybersecurity,
                and AI.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, coding is something I genuinely enjoy. I like learning
                new programming languages, building things, and understanding
                how technology works behind the scenes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Out of everything in tech, ethical hacking and cybersecurity
                interest me the most because I find it exciting to learn about
                system security, vulnerabilities, and how hackers think.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the same time, I also enjoy using AI tools and understanding
                how AI can make work smarter and easier.
              </p>

              <p>
                After completing Class 12, I want to move completely into the
                coding and tech field. My goal is to build a future in
                cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and AI.
              </p>

              <p>
                I know there's still a lot to learn, but I enjoy the process
                and always try to improve my skills step by step.
              </p>

              <p>
                For me, technology is not just a career option anymore —
                it's something I truly connect with and see myself doing
                in the future.
